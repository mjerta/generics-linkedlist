<h1Overview</h1>
This Java project demonstrates the functionality of a custom LinkedList class through a series of operations. The Main class is used to showcase how to add, remove, update, and query elements within the linked list.

Key Operations
Initialization:

A LinkedList instance of type String is created.
Adding Elements:

Elements are added to the list using the add method.
Example: Adding "A", "B", "C", "D" to the list.
Printing Elements:

The current elements of the list are printed using the printOutAllItems method.
Removing Elements:

Elements can be removed from the list using the remove method.
Example: Removing "E" from the list.
Inserting Elements at Specific Index:

Elements can be added at a specific index using the add(int index, E element) method.
Example: Adding "added-entry" at index 2.
Adding Multiple Elements:

Arrays of elements can be added to the list using the addAll method.
Example: Adding "new-entry1", "new-entry2" to the list.
Adding elements at a specific index using addAll(int index, Collection<? extends E> c).
Checking List Status:

Checking if the list is empty using the isEmpty method.
Example: linkedList.isEmpty().
Updating Elements:

Elements can be updated at a specific index using the set(int index, E element) method.
Example: Updating the element at index 2 to "updated-entry".
Retrieving Elements:

Elements can be retrieved from a specific index using the get(int index) method.
Example: Retrieving the element at index 2.
Removing Specific Elements:

Removing specific elements from the list using the removeAll method.
Example: Removing "new-entry3", "new-entry4".
List Size:

The size of the list can be checked using the size method.
Example: linkedList.size().
Clearing the List:

All elements can be removed from the list using the clear method.
Checking if the list is empty after clearing it using isEmpty and size methods.
